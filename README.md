(which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
For Alpha, level should be blocked out and additional elements should be in place for testing. Beta objects should take place of leveling blocking, all additonal elements should be functional and in place, project should require minimal details to bring it to final release. Alpha testing should allow tester to go through the level, interact with elements, and complete the level. Beta testing should resemble the final release, tester should be able to play the game with full functionality. Limited issues should be presnet and level design should be near completion.
