Project Log Assignments

*Module Two Team Project Plan:
Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
Scenario: Top Down 
Additional Elements:
1. Enemies Stationary (Ian)
2. Moving Obstacles (Korbin)
3. Equipment Pickups (Devin)
4. Enemy Boss (Alec)

Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
Castle/Fantasy themed, fire traps, swords, armor, 

Create a schedule or timeline for developing your game based on due dates outlined within the course.
Additional Elements- end of week 3
Level Block out for alpha release- middle of week 4
Alpha Testing- weekend of week 4
Beta testing- weekend of week 5
Final Preparations- Week 6
Completed Final Project- week 7

Determine the development goals for the Alpha and Beta Stage submissions 
(which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
For Alpha, level should be blocked out and additional elements should be in place for testing. Beta objects should take place of leveling blocking, all additonal elements should be functional and in place, project should require minimal details to bring it to final release. Alpha testing should allow tester to go through the level, interact with elements, and complete the level. Beta testing should resemble the final release, tester should be able to play the game with full functionality. Limited issues should be present and level design should be near completion.

Choose preferred communication method(s).
Discord

Choose the frequency of communication (team meeting).
Weekly group meeting with additional direct communication as needed

Choose a method for assigning and reporting on specific task items.
Team members each chose a specific element to produce. Each team member will be assigned a specific area of development(level design, player, etc.).

*Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan:

How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
Components will undergo basic testing after completion to not slow down development. We will implement more rigorous testing after components are added to the level. We have developed a testing plan to track features, bugs, and updates/resolutions.

  Play Test: By the end of week 4 we will begin playtesting and reporting bugs.
  
  Demo: Week five we will fix issues found during testing to further refine gameplay for the demo.
  
  Code Release: Week 7 the project will be finalized and ready for release.

What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
•	Game controls
•	Health/Armor system
•	Damage system
•	Enemies
•	Traps
•	Boss
•	Player HUD
•	Game Over system

How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
There is a section in our test plan to describe what changes, if any, were made. If the component failed or was unable to be completed the reason would be put in this section

How will bugs be reported?
Bugs will be tracked in our test plan. Each feature will have a spot to report bugs.

How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
In the test plan there is a section to track bugs. After the bugs section there is an additional section for runtime errors to also be tracked. At the end there is a section to describe what updates or error resolutions were made.

*Module Four Project Log - Team Reflection

What parts of the testing process did the team perceive to go well?
During testing we tracked our bugs and discussed them within the group. This was helpful because we could share ideas and possibly helpful links to material that could help us solve our issues. We each tested our own parts as we developed to reduce the amount of bugs present when it came time to test the alpha.

How were bugs identified and corrected?
During testing bugs were identified and tracked in the group test plan. If issues or errors were encountered we made notes of the issues and discussed them with the group for feedback and solutions.

In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
If possible we would increase the amount of time for testing. Given more time we would have been able to have less issues present in our alpha. Meeting more often would also have been more helpful going into and during the testing phase.

What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha project? Why?
Discord did help with communication. Having all members in a group with the ability to look back through the messages and ability to send links easily made communication easier. We also liked using UE5 for developing the project. UE5 has a lot of helpful resources that make developing simple. It is also easy to find material to help solve issues we encounter because of the vast community using UE5. Google Sheets was helpful with tracking bugs during testing.

Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
GitHub was ticky because some of the group had less exprience with it or had never used it with a group. Working remotely has its own challenges as well with communication being infrequent at times.

How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute to the decision to use these tools and techniques?
During the initial analysis we came to our decision based on the requirements provided for the project. We used UE5.4 instead of the current version because the majority of members had that version installed already. Google Sheets was used for tracking the test plan because it was something we could easily share and the design of the document was based on a spreadsheet used in a previous class. Discord was an easy method for us all to connect and communicate in one spot.

*Module Five Project Log - Team Reflection

What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?


What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?


How were the previous evaluations integrated into this latest stage?


What would you do differently to improve the collaboration or development process?


Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?


Identify the completed stage of development of the intended Beta and address the project schedule to meet Final Release development deadline.
