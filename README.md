Project Log Assignments

*Module Two Team Project Plan:
Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
Scenario: Top Down 
Additional Elements:
1. Enemies Stationary (Ian)
2. Moving Obstacles (Korbin)
3. Equipment Pickups (Devin)
4. Enemy Boss (Alec)

Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
Castle/Fantasy themed, fire traps, swords, armor, 

Create a schedule or timeline for developing your game based on due dates outlined within the course.
Additional Elements- end of week 3
Level Block out for alpha release- middle of week 4
Alpha Testing- weekend of week 4
Beta testing- weekend of week 5
Final Preparations- Week 6
Completed Final Project- week 7

Determine the development goals for the Alpha and Beta Stage submissions 
(which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
For Alpha, level should be blocked out and additional elements should be in place for testing. Beta objects should take place of leveling blocking, all additonal elements should be functional and in place, project should require minimal details to bring it to final release. Alpha testing should allow tester to go through the level, interact with elements, and complete the level. Beta testing should resemble the final release, tester should be able to play the game with full functionality. Limited issues should be present and level design should be near completion.

Choose preferred communication method(s).
Discord

Choose the frequency of communication (team meeting).
Weekly group meeting with additional direct communication as needed

Choose a method for assigning and reporting on specific task items.
Team members each chose a specific element to produce. Each team member will be assigned a specific area of development(level design, player, etc.).
